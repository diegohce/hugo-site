      <description>When I first setup this blog in Netlify the self assigned name by Netlfy was loving-tereshkova-0ad45 (or some hash alike).
It seems that Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova, from Russia, was the first cosmonaut woman to flight into space. This was 1963!
I think that, for a technology related blog, this is a very proper name, at last while hosted in this subdomain :-)</description>
