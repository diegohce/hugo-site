      <description>As a software achitect, sometimes, people is more challenging than software. Bad practices propagates at speed of light because, like it or not, programmers tend to copy-paste more than you think (and more than they like to admit).
So, you find yourself building a really small microservice reusing code from another project (yes, copy-pasting), and there it is; the boogie man code waiting for you in the dark corner of some critical and productive code.</description>

      <description>When I first setup this blog in Netlify the self assigned name by Netlfy was loving-tereshkova-0ad45 (or some hash alike).
It seems that Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova, from Russia, was the first cosmonaut woman to flight into space. This was 1963!
I think that, for a technology related blog, this is a very proper name, at last while hosted in this subdomain :-)</description>
